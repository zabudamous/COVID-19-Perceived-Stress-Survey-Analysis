# COVID-19 Perceived Stress Survey Analysis

This project explores perceived stress levels across demographic groups during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020).  
I designed and distributed a survey using the **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)**, collected 490 responses, and applied **nonparametric resampling methods** (permutation tests and bootstrapping) to assess stress differences across gender, age, employment, student, and essential worker groups.

## Key Findings
- Women reported significantly higher stress than men (1â€“6 points higher on the PSS).
- Younger adults (<30) reported significantly higher stress than older adults.
- Employment, student, and essential worker status showed no statistically significant differences.
- Patterns suggest potential compounding effects of gender and work status.
